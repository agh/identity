# Alex Howells

### Sending me communication via e-mail...

All mail should [be sent to me here](mailto:alex@howells.me).

### Letting me SSH into your infrastructure...

If you need to give me access to any system via SSH then my public keys are
listed here and you can select between ED25519 or 4096-bit RSA keys.
These are listed in order of suggested preference.

All my keys are wrapped together `authorized_keys` for [easy download](https://github.com/agh/identity/raw/main/ssh/authorized_keys)

Just drop the contents of that file into `/home/username/.ssh/authorized_keys`
and all should be well.
